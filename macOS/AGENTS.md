Operational Notes
- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Prefer values from `.nvmrc` files as the source of truth for Node versions.
- Read NOTES.md first to understand the repository layout, services, versions, and common commands.
- When new repos are introduced, add their key scripts, ports, and setup tips to NOTES.md.
